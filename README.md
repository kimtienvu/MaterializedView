# MaterializedView
Project for CS 666 Advanced Distributed Systems by Kim Tien Vu & Jaskirat Singh Nandhra. This project will compare the execution times of utilizing a min-heap to traversing a binary search tree to find the optimal materialized view.

## Dependencies:
* MySQL database connection
* Python 3

## Compiling and running:
* Execute `python3 BinaryTree.py` on the command line to run the code
* If you do not have a MySQL database connection, you can randomly generate a list of build_time and block_access to simulate materialized view (mv) node creation. Note that these two lists MUST BE THE SAME SIZE.
